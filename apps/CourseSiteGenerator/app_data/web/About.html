        <h2>About</h2>
        
        <p>Course Site Generator was conceived of, designed, and implemented by
            <a href='http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~richard'>Richard McKenna and Shilong Li</a>
            of <a href='http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu'>Stony Brook University</a>.
            
            The application was built in order to help learning about making
            user interface frameworks and employs the <strong>PropertiesManager(Thanks:))</strong>,
            <strong>jTPS</strong>, and <strong>Desktop Java Framework</strong> libraries,
            also created by and maintained by Richard McKenna. This Course Site Generator helps building
            pages for courses.<br />
